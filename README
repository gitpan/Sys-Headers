Sys/Headers version 0.01
========================

DESCRIPTION

This is alpha code.

This is alpha code.

This is alpha code.

This module will use L<h2ph> to convert your systems header files
into Perl header files.  It should be stated that h2ph isn't very
good at this, it has some bugs.  However, if you can handle a few
warnings every now and again, and you need access to information
contained in the header files, use this module.

First you need to build a repository of Perl header files.  This
requires having write access to the place where Sys::Headers is
installed.  This limitation will most likley change.

Once you've done that, you can use these headers at compile time
by listing the ones you want in similar fashion to C<#include> from
C.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install
